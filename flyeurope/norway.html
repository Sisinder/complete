          <p>
      Pure research is important to all areas of society and is a vital factor in higher education and researcher recruitment. Pure research has also laid the foundation for wealth creation in Norway in areas such as the oil and gas, aluminum and aquaculture industries. Norwegian business enterprises reported a total of NOK 18.2 billion in research and development (R&D) expenditure in 2009.
One of the main priorities of Norway’s research policy is to further strengthen long-term pure research efforts in all subject areas at universities, university colleges and research institutes. These institutions form the cornerstone of the Norwegian research system: this is where research-based teaching takes place, where new researchers are recruited, and where new knowledge is generated and disseminated to society and industry.
