There are also few private universities in France. The academic session starts in September or October and ends in May or June, depending on the type of program and institution that a candidate chooses. There are 2 semesters, divided by a break followed by final examinations at the end of the first semester. There are 2 types of courses offered at the French universities:
Large lecture classes: This type, of course, are designed for a smaller group of students, where the professor addresses the class, and the students take notes, and sections & labs, where the material covered during lecture hours is explored in greater details. The attendance is mandatory during classes. Few career-oriented programs also need internships and practical training.
When it comes to degrees, the French universities use a format accessible throughout EU: licence, master, doctorate. The licence applies to undergraduate studies, and it lasts for six semesters (3 years), with 180 ECTS earned. Master studies continue for an additional four semesters (2 years), for a total of 5 years of study and 300 ECTS earned. The doctorate is obtained after the additional six semesters (3 years).
It’s also essential to know that every university has an internship referral system and a career services office, where you can always know of the most recent internship and job opportunities available to you.</p>
